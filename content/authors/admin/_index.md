## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Ecology at Duke University, working under the supervision of [Dr. Jean Gibert](https://jeanpgibert.weebly.com/). My research explores how rapid phenotypic changes occurring within ecological timescales influence species interactions, food web dynamics, and evolutionary trajectories. Specifically, I investigate how global warming mediates these complex ecological interactions. My approach integrates theoretical modeling, experimental methods, bioinformatics, and data science to elucidate the mechanisms driving trait changes in species responding to constantly shifting environmental conditions.

Prior to joining Duke, I earned my B.S. in Biology from the College of William & Mary, where I conducted research with [Dr. Jelena Pantel](https://jhpantel.com/) on the impacts of intra- and interspecific phenotypic variation on competition coefficient.
